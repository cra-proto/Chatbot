    <h2>About the CRA Chatbot</h2>
    <p>The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) is dedicated to providing taxpayers the information they need quickly. Our chatbot service is here to answer your non-account specific questions anytime.</p>
    <p>Use the CRA chatbot to easily find information needed to file your income tax and benefit return. Remember, the chatbot is constantly learning from the questions it receives, helping it become better at providing useful responses.</p>
    <p>You can find the CRA chatbot on the CRA homepage and many other pages on Canada.ca. The chatbot is available 24/7 throughout the year.</p>

    <h3>Privacy Notice</h3>
    <p>Please avoid sharing any personal or account-specific information when using the chatbot. While the chatbot may store your questions to improve its service, it does not retain any personal data or interaction history. For more information, please view our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/privacy-notice.html">Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

    <h2>Help Using the CRA Chatbot</h2>
    <p>To start a conversation, click on the chat icon in the lower right corner of this page and type your question.</p>
    <p>If the chatbot does not answer your question, consider these tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rephrase your question. Instead of saying "I entered some wrong information on my return and I don't know how to fix," say "How do I change my return?"</li>
        <li>Ask one question at a time. Instead of "I have to complete my return and don't know how. Does it have to be done online or can I use paper? When do I have to send it in by?" try "How do I file my return?"</li>
        <li>Use simple terms like "T400A," "T2," "Charities."</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you still need help after using the chatbot, consider our other self-serve options or our <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/contact-information.html">phone lines</a>.</p>
    <p>If you're having issues accessing the chatbot, it may be due to browser compatibility. Ensure you are using an up-to-date version of Chrome, Edge, or Safari.</p>
